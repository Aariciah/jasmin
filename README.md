Jasmin corpus is a spoken Dutch corpus containing children, elderly and non-native Dutch speakers. In this repo we benchmark a standard Dutch ASR system (on CGN) in various types of speech in Jasmin

This repo requires a well trained Dutch ASR system in Kaldi. Please refer to [https://github.com/laurensw75/kaldi_egs_CGN] by laurensw75 for implementation of CGN trained Dutch ASR system.
